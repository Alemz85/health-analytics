-- Blood panels / lab reports. The owner's own lab results, kept alongside every
-- other health fact so the one storage location serves all three consumers: the
-- desktop app (Profile section), the chat agent (chatctx/db.py runs unrestricted
-- read-only SQL, so a table is readable the moment it exists), and future trend
-- charts once more than one panel exists.
--
-- The SOURCE PDFs deliberately do not live here or in git — they carry name,
-- date of birth and fiscal code, and git history is forever. They stay on disk
-- under /Health (gitignored); only the extracted results are stored. `source_file`
-- records which report a row came from, as provenance, not as a fetchable path.
--
-- Same access model as gym/injuries/goals: RLS deny-all, service role bypasses.

-- One row per analyte. Values are stored BOTH parsed and raw on purpose:
--   value_num / ref_low / ref_high  drive charts, comparisons and the flag
--   value_text / ref_text           preserve exactly what the report printed
-- Italian lab reports state reference ranges in wildly varying shapes — "4,0-10,0",
-- "Uomo 22 - 322", "Fino a 1,20", "< 34", multi-tier vitamin-D bands. Anything the
-- importer cannot reduce to numeric bounds keeps ref_text alone and leaves the
-- numeric columns null, so an unparseable range NEVER silently becomes a wrong
-- number. Same principle as the ingest function's FIELD_MAP: centralise the
-- format assumptions and keep the raw payload.
