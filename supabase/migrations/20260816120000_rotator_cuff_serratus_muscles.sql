-- Rotator cuff and serratus anterior enter the muscle vocabulary.
--
-- The 21-value vocab had no entry for either, so when the catalog's empty
-- primary_muscles were filled on 2026-08-10 six cuff/scapular rehab movements
-- were forced onto the nearest listed muscle (agent_log #22):
--
--   Band/Cable External Rotation -> 'rear delts'   (really infraspinatus + teres minor)
--   Band Internal Rotation       -> 'front delts'  (really subscapularis)
--   Supine Floor / Wall / Prone Overhead Arm Slide -> 'traps' alone
--                                                  (really lower trap + serratus anterior)
--
-- CONSEQUENCE this fixes: the muscle/volume analytics join gym_sets ->
-- exercises, so every one of this user's rear-delt and front-delt figures was
-- inflated by shoulder rehab that is not delt training — and the cuff work is
-- deliberately high-frequency and light, so it is a large share of those sets.
-- Because the labels live on the exercises row rather than on each set,
-- re-pointing the six rows corrects all history retroactively.
--
-- Keep this vocabulary in sync with muscleFatigue.ts MUSCLES (+ GROUP_MEMBERSHIP,
-- MUSCLE_ISO_JOINT, muscleSizeFactor), chatctx/gym.py MUSCLES,
-- chatctx/workout_template_contract.mjs, and scripts/seed_exercises.ts.

-- CHECK constraints must be dropped and re-added — Postgres can't extend one in
-- place. The new vocab is a strict SUPERSET, so every existing row still passes.

-- Re-point the six mislabelled rows. Each update is guarded on the exact wrong

-- External rotation: the cuff's external rotators are the prime movers. The
-- posterior deltoid genuinely assists, so it moves to SECONDARY rather than
-- being dropped — the error was calling it the prime mover, not naming it.
