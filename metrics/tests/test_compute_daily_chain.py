"""F1 regression: the incremental daily CTL/ATL/ACWR chain must preserve the
stored TRIMP of workouts OUTSIDE the recompute window.

Before the fix, trimp_by_id was seeded only from the freshly-recomputed
RECOMPUTE_DAYS window, so every older workout resolved to 0.0 — silently
rewriting all pre-window computed_daily rows (and their CTL/ATL/ACWR) to zero on
each nightly run. This drives run(full=False) through a fully faked db layer and
asserts a pre-window workout's day keeps its stored trimp_total."""
