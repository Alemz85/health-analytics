"""End-to-end wiring test for run_zone2_fitness against a fake db layer.

Pins the compute-level v4 fixes the pure-math tests cannot reach:
  - strength/core workouts never feed w(t)/sessions/B (fix 1)
  - per-day CAUSAL B/τ_slow/floor + B decaying through a training gap (fix 3)
  - per-day causal days_since_vo2max, never negative, None before first (fix 3)
  - anchor_beta key no longer written; new horizon columns on every row (7/10)
  - continuous confidence in [0,1] falling as signals stale; band widening (7/8)
  - warn_after_days stored as the CONTINUOUS horizon (fix 10)
