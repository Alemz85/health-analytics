# Insights statistical design

This document is the contract for the personal Insights engine. The engine is
an N-of-1 observational screen: it can identify repeatable within-person
associations worth acting on or testing deliberately, but it cannot turn
wearable data into causal claims.

## Questions, not a correlation grab bag

Every candidate must declare four things before it is evaluated:

1. the exposure time and outcome time;
2. the population of days or workouts to which the estimate applies;
3. the variables available before the exposure/outcome that must be adjusted;
4. the minimum information and stability gates required to surface it.

Variables are not added merely because a database column exists. In
particular, daily active energy, wrist temperature, weight, protein, gym-set RPE,
HRR60, and modality-specific decoupling currently lack enough observations.
Walking/running distance is almost a duplicate of steps and is not an
independent hypothesis. REM/deep/core shares are compositional and consumer
sleep-stage classification is too uncertain for three separate inferential
claims; the engine uses only the less ambitious awake fraction as a sleep
continuity proxy.

## Temporal ordering

The row labelled date `t` contains the sleep ending on `t`. Respiratory rate
is treated as sleep-associated. RHR and HRV are different: Health Auto Export
sends one midnight-stamped daily aggregate and later exports can revise it
after a workout on `t`. The final stored RHR/HRV value is therefore not known
before that workout.

This creates the following legal ordering:

```
load / ambient activity on t-1
        ↓
sleep-associated context on t
        ↓
workout choice and recorded intensity later on t
```

That ordering applies to sleep-derived variables, not final same-day RHR/HRV.
For RHR/HRV the legal workout predictor is the finalized aggregate from
`t-1`. A same-date relationship may be screened only as co-measured, with
within-day order and causal direction explicitly unresolved.

ATL and CTL computed for `t` already include the workout on `t`. They must
never control an analysis of sleep or morning recovery on `t`, and they must
not control an analysis in which the workout on `t` is the outcome. The daily
frame therefore exposes:

- `atl_prior` and `ctl_prior`: load state through `t-1`, available before a
  workout on `t`;
- `ctl_pre_exposure`: load state through `t-2`, available before a prior-day
  load exposure on `t-1`.

Personal baselines also use history strictly before the current observation.
Current sleep is not allowed to pull its own baseline toward itself.

Workout time has two distinct representations. Absolute instants determine
elapsed recovery time, hours since waking, and event order. Local clock and
calendar questions use HAE's original timestamp offset retained in the compact
workout `raw` summary, but only after verifying that it resolves to the same
instant as normalized `start_at`; otherwise the configured timezone is the
fallback. This prevents travel from moving a workout to the home-timezone hour
while preserving exact elapsed durations across offsets and DST.

Sleep follows the same split. Duration and wake-to-workout intervals use
absolute instants. Sleep midpoint and wake-clock features use the UTC offset
recorded on Apple's sleep-end timestamp when it differs from the configured
home-zone offset; matching offsets retain the configured IANA zone so DST
rules remain exact. The offset is stored inside the atomic sleep JSON group,
and archived values are backfilled only when both stored sleep instants exactly
match the raw aggregate.

Daily sleep aggregates are not automatically treated as the night's main
sleep. A row enters any sleep hypothesis only when it lasts at least three
hours, has valid ordered start/end instants, its reported duration does not
exceed the elapsed span by more than 15 minutes, and no more than three hours
of the span is unaccounted for. When Apple stages are present, core + deep + REM
must be positive. This fixed measurement-quality contract excludes naps,
awake-only exports, and widely separated episodes stitched into one span. The
rows remain stored and visible; only inferential sleep features are missing.

## Daily recovery families

### Prior-day behavior to next sleep/recovery

Exposures are prior-day TRIMP, prior-day steps, prior-day flights climbed, and
prior-day high-zone fraction. A separate seven-day training-time distribution
exposure uses `(sum daily duration)^2 / sum(daily duration^2)`: the effective
number of equally sized training days in the preceding week. Duration is used
instead of TRIMP so a workout with absent or incomplete HR cannot become a
false rest day. The measure ranges from 1 (all weekly time on one day) to 7
(evenly spread), is invariant to duration scale, is missing for an all-rest
week, and always controls total seven-day training time, previous-day load, and
pre-exposure chronic load.
Flights add vertical activity that steps do not fully encode: in the current
data their correlation is 0.66, while walking/running distance is effectively a
duplicate of steps at 0.99. Outcomes are sleep shortfall relative to the prior
28-day median, sleep awake fraction, and respiratory-rate deviation relative to
its prior 28-day median. Finalized same-day RHR/HRV aggregates are excluded from
this directed family because a workout later on the outcome date can contribute
to their final value.

Each outcome controls its previous value and the pre-exposure chronic load.
TRIMP and steps control one another. The flights candidate controls both, so a
long active workout or high-step day cannot masquerade as an independent
stair-climbing effect. Flights is not forced into the established TRIMP and
steps candidates: it starts later, and complete-case deletion would silently
redefine those analyses around the newer sensor era.

High-zone fraction asks a different conditional question: among days on which
training occurred, does intensity composition matter beyond total TRIMP? It is
defined only when every workout that day passes the HR coverage gate; rest days
and partly measured workout days stay missing rather than becoming zero. The
candidate controls total TRIMP, steps, prior chronic load, and the previous
outcome. This prevents it from merely rediscovering training versus rest or a
larger overall dose.

### Co-measured sleep and recovery

Sleep shortfall, sleep-midpoint drift, signed sleep-midpoint shift, and sleep
awake fraction are screened against RHR, HRV, and respiratory-rate deviation.
Clock time is circular: a 23:55 midpoint is close to 00:05. The baseline first
uses the circular mean of the prior 28 calendar days as an unwrap center, then
the median of those unwrapped values for robustness. Signed shift is wrapped
to [-12, 12) hours (positive means later than usual); drift is its absolute
magnitude. Keeping both distinguishes a direction-specific phase association
from irregular timing in either direction. These are explicitly labelled
co-measured associations. For RHR/HRV, “co-measured” means same-date association
with a finalized full-day aggregate, not a morning-readiness measurement.
Prior ATL and the previous outcome are controls.

## Workout-context families

Workout analyses use one row per workout with positive duration. Duration is
recorded independently of HR, so an otherwise valid workout is not discarded
merely because its HR stream is absent or incomplete. HR-derived outcomes have
a stricter population: positive TRIMP, at least five minutes of classified HR,
and classified-HR time between 90% and 105% of recorded duration. The upper
tolerance allows small timestamp/rounding disagreement but rejects internally
inconsistent records. This is a fixed measurement-quality rule, not a
data-tuned significance threshold. Rest days are not members of either
population. Multiple sessions on one local date remain separate workout
observations, but they share the same morning recovery exposure and parts of
the same daily environment. They therefore count as one date for
minimum-information gates and as one cluster for uncertainty.

Outcome eligibility does not erase event history. Every recorded workout,
including a short or HR-sparse session that cannot supply a stable outcome,
updates time since the previous workout and time since the previous workout of
that modality. Any positive measured TRIMP from such a session also contributes
to the load already accumulated before a later same-day outcome row. Every
positive-duration session likewise contributes to a separate same-day duration
control, even when HR is absent. Previous-modality HR-outcome controls remain
restricted to HR-eligible rows because a
short or poorly covered session cannot supply a stable intensity ratio.
Duration history, however, advances on every positive-duration workout.

The outcomes deliberately separate different questions:

- total recorded TRIMP: the scheduled dose chosen for a session whose HR stream
  passes the completeness gate;
- duration: how long the session was;
- TRIMP per measured HR minute: recorded cardiovascular intensity. Dividing by
  full workout duration would silently treat every unmeasured second as zero
  effort. Duration remains adjusted because intensity and sustainable duration
  trade off;
- Apple energy intensity: the workout summary in `kcal/(hour·kg)` (numerically
  MET-like). It supplies a separate device-estimated effort outcome when HR is
  absent or incomplete. Only explicit MET or `kcal/hr·kg` units and values from
  0.5–25 are accepted; no value is reconstructed from energy or body weight;
- high-zone fraction: the fraction of measured HR time in zones 4-5.

Neither intensity measure nor high-zone fraction is labelled “capacity.”
Capacity would require a standardized task, pace/power, and preferably
perceived exertion. Apple energy intensity is also not measured mechanical
power; it is a device estimate. These outcomes answer how hard the recorded
session was, conditional on doing a workout.

Workout readiness candidates relate sleep shortfall, three-night mean
shortfall, sleep timing drift, signed sleep timing shift, sleep awake fraction,
previous-day finalized RHR/HRV, sleep-associated respiratory-rate deviation,
and previous-day high-zone fraction to duration, TRIMP per measured HR minute,
and Apple energy intensity. The high-zone candidate controls total prior-day
load and exists only after a fully HR-covered training day. The three-night
exposure requires three complete consecutive
calendar days; it is not imputed across a missing night. Prior acute load and
time since the previous workout are also screened as pre-workout state
candidates. Hours since waking is screened separately because clock time and
biological-day position are not the same exposure.

The preceding week's effective training-day count is also screened against
duration and each intensity outcome. Its candidate-specific controls include
total seven-day training time, so it asks about distribution conditional on
volume rather than treating “more training days” as automatically more
training.

Every workout fit controls chronic and acute load through the prior day,
previous-day load, modality, time since the previous workout, time since the
previous workout of that modality, and any load already accumulated earlier
that day. It also controls the log of recorded workout minutes already
completed that day and the log of positive-duration minutes in the same
modality during the preceding 28 days. Both remain available when HR-derived
load does not. Modality recency and recent modality exposure are related but
not equivalent: a one-day gap can occur near the start of a return block or
after a dense month. The latter control reduces sport-specific reacclimation,
practice, and training-block confounding; it does not claim to measure
technique. A candidate is removed from its own control list. The same-day
controls are essential: an evening session is more likely than a morning
session to be a second session, and otherwise “time of day” could merely
rediscover accumulated same-day fatigue.

Same-day sleep, timing, continuity, and respiratory context enters a workout
row only when the recorded sleep end precedes the workout by no more than 20
hours. This prevents a late-night or early-morning workout from borrowing a
sleep episode that ends later. Previous-day finalized RHR/HRV and prior-load
state do not depend on that gate. Other missing measurements reduce a
candidate's own sample; they do not cause imputation.

### Workout time of day

Clock time is circular: 23:30 is close to 00:30, not 23 hours away. The clock
comes from the verified offset recorded at the workout location, not the
currently configured home timezone. Timing is therefore modelled with a
24-hour cosinor (sine and cosine jointly), never as a raw linear hour or
arbitrary morning/evening split. The joint two-degree-of-freedom test reports:

- partial effect size after controls;
- the fitted peak clock time when a stable curve exists;
- bootstrap phase concentration, so a statistically non-zero but wandering
  peak does not surface.

Modality fixed effects, weekday, secular trend, prior load state, hours since
waking, and relevant duration are controls. Hours since waking is essential in
this data: it correlates 0.91 with clock time, so a clock-only fit would mostly
rediscover position in the waking day. These controls reduce—but cannot
eliminate—confounding from a schedule such as “rowing happens in the evening,
walking happens in the morning.” A result remains an association with recorded
training behavior, not proof of a circadian mechanism or a recommendation to
move every session.

The secular trend is elapsed calendar time, not workout row number. Two
sessions on one date receive the same trend value, and a week without training
still advances the trend by seven days.

## Inference gates

Daily and workout candidates are separate predeclared multiple-testing
families. Every candidate passes the same policy:

- at least 60 usable observations and at least 30 effective observations; a
  workout candidate additionally needs at least 60 distinct workout dates;
- for cosinor fits, at least 10 distinct workout dates represented in each of
  morning, afternoon, and evening/night so repeated sessions on a few dates
  cannot create apparent clock-time coverage;
- weekday, annual sine/cosine, and secular-trend adjustment;
- deterministic collapse of highly collinear controls;
- HAC/Newey-West uncertainty for ordered observations; workout fits also use
  date-clustered uncertainty and take the less favorable p-value and the
  confidence-interval envelope across the two estimators;
- Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery control within the declared family;
- moving-block bootstrap stability (sign stability for scalar effects,
  circular phase stability for timing effects); workout blocks sample calendar
  days and retain every session from a sampled date together;
- Pearson/partial-Spearman agreement for scalar effects so one extreme day
  cannot promote an otherwise absent relationship;
- circular-shift placebo calibration;
- candidate-specific placebo suppression: a real candidate cannot promote when
  its own shifted null also clears the gates;
- seven consecutive qualifying nightly runs before promotion, plus symmetric
  demotion hysteresis.

Exploratory correlations remain a hypothesis-discovery surface. They use a
trailing 180-day window, effective-sample correction, rank-correlation
robustness, and FDR q-values. Workout-load outcomes include workout days only
at every lag. Lag zero is withheld when RHR or HRV is placed on the driver side;
their final same-day aggregate cannot precede performance.

## Measurement-time audit (2026-08-02)

Real `raw_payloads`, which outrank the vendor documentation, show RHR, HRV,
and respiratory rate arriving as one entry per local date stamped `00:00:00`.
Across the recent repeated exports, HRV changed on 22 of 23 re-exported dates
and RHR on 14 of 22. On eight workout dates, an HRV value had already been
exported before the workout and was revised by a later export. The ingest merge
correctly retains the latest non-null aggregate for display, but that final
value cannot be used retrospectively as if it had been observed before the
workout. Daily model version 9 and workout model version 15 enforce the
prior-day rule above, preserve recorded local sleep time during travel, reject
non-main-sleep aggregates, and use circular signed/absolute timing baselines.
These versions also retain the fully measured,
training-day-conditional high-zone composition exposure. Workout version 9
separates duration from HR-outcome eligibility, normalizes HR intensity by
measured time, and admits the explicit Apple energy-intensity summary as a
separate outcome. Readiness and pre-workout state are screened against
high-zone fraction as well as average HR-zone and energy intensity.

## Current data implications (audit 2026-08-02)

- 577 daily rows are present; steps and walking distance are complete, while
  flights climbed has 442 days.
- Sleep has 281 stored aggregates, of which 274 pass the main-sleep inference
  contract; RHR has 259 days, HRV 311, and respiratory rate 286. RHR/HRV are
  eligible as co-measured daily aggregates and prior-day predictors, not as
  same-day readiness measurements.
- Active energy has 25 days, weight 39, wrist temperature 0, protein 1, and
  detailed gym sessions 5: these remain dormant.
- Prior-day flights candidates have 149–173 complete cases after outcome and
  control availability. None currently clears the multiplicity and stability
  gates; adding the variable did not manufacture a result.
- Workout temperature and humidity exist on 101 sessions across 70 dates, but
  most are indoor strength, rowing, cycling, or pool sessions and the historic
  running block lacks them. They are not treated as physiological ambient
  exposure until the source semantics and outdoor coverage are trustworthy.
- 224 positive-duration workouts across 190 dates can inform duration
  behavior. Of the 108 sessions that otherwise have positive HR-derived load
  and at least five classified minutes, 102 sessions across 73 dates pass the
  90% coverage gate. The six failures are outdoor walks with only 60.5%–87.8%
  coverage; leaving the old denominator in place would have made those gaps
  look like low effort.
- There are 27 multi-session dates and 34 later same-day sessions. Version 15
  controls duration accumulated before each later session independently of HR
  coverage; an unmeasured earlier workout can no longer masquerade as no prior
  same-day work. It also adjusts every workout fit for prior-28-day duration in
  that workout's modality.
- Complete waking-day timing frames currently contain 84 sessions on 56 dates
  for duration and 78 sessions on 53 dates for HR-derived intensity, so both
  remain dormant under the 60-date timing rule. Clock time and hours since
  waking correlate 0.91 in the observed frame, reinforcing the need for that
  control rather than a clock-only interpretation.
- Five Portugal workouts retained a `+0100` recorded offset while the configured
  Rome timezone was `+0200`; their old clock values were one hour late. Version
  10 uses the recorded local hour for those sessions, while exact hours since
  waking and recovery gaps remain unchanged. No current workout crosses a date
  boundary under the correction, and no model verdict changes.
- All 281 stored sleep aggregates match an archived raw aggregate exactly.
  Seven are not plausible main sleep: three are sub-three-hour or awake-only
  episodes and four are stitched spans with more than three unaccounted hours
  (2025-08-14; 2026-01-09–12, 15, and 18). They remain visible but cannot
  contribute duration, midpoint, continuity, wake-time, or readiness values.
  A different set of seven
  Portugal nights (July 24–30) retained `+0100` while Rome was `+0200`; the old
  sleep-midpoint and wake-clock values were one hour late. Versions 9/15 use
  the recorded sleep offset for local-clock features. Absolute sleep duration
  and wake-to-workout intervals were already correct.
- Duration candidates now use measurements according to their own semantics:
  sleep continuity has 94 sessions on 63 dates, prior-day HRV has 103 on 72,
  and prior acute load / previous-workout gap have 217 on 184. Corresponding
  intensity candidates retain only HR-quality rows (85/58, 93/67, and 95/68,
  respectively). Three-night sleep shortfall remains dormant for both duration
  (64/43) and intensity (58/40). None clears multiplicity and stability gates;
  greater eligibility is not evidence of an effect.
- Apple energy intensity exists for 110 sessions on 77 dates across strength,
  rowing, cycling, walking, swimming, surfing, and one indoor run. It overlaps
  102 HR-quality sessions but correlates only 0.67 with HR-zone intensity, so it
  is related rather than redundant. None of its candidates clears the gates.
  The expanded 57-candidate workout family has 17 testable candidates, zero
  raw signals or watches, and zero of 56 tested
  shifted placebos fires.
- High-zone composition is known for 69 prior-workout exposure days, only 25
  of which contain any zone 4–5 time. The next-recovery candidates currently
  have 50–58 complete pairs; next-workout candidates have only 19 distinct
  dates. All six remain explicitly dormant under the fixed 60-observation/date
  gates rather than being padded with rest-day zeroes.
- Prior-week training-time spread is defined on 730 historical dates (201 in
  the recent year). Its daily recovery candidates have 135–163 complete
  adjusted cases;
  none clears the gates. Workout duration has 173/142 sessions/dates and Apple
  energy intensity has 91/62, so both are testable; HR-zone outcomes remain
  dormant at 84/59. The expanded daily family has 31 candidates (28 testable,
  two raw signals and one watch still awaiting persistence; one of 78 shifted
  placebos fires). The workout family has 57 candidates (17 testable, no raw
  signal or watch; zero of 56 shifted placebos fires).
- Circular signed sleep phase is defined on 235 dates and correlates only 0.17
  with absolute timing drift, confirming that it asks a distinct question.
  Its four daily candidates have 166–222 adjusted observations; none is clear
  after FDR (q = 0.31–0.69). Workout duration and Apple energy candidates have
  82 sessions on 55 dates, while HR-zone outcomes have 76 on 52; all remain
  dormant under the fixed 60-date rule.
- Prior-28-day same-modality exposure is zero for 29 workout rows, has a median
  of 102 minutes, and reaches 457 minutes. For the 16 swim sessions, four start
  with no prior-month swim volume; log exposure and log time since the prior
  swim correlate -0.81, strong but not redundant. The new control is retained
  in all 17 testable workout fits. The complete 57-candidate replay remains at
  zero raw signals or watches and zero of 56 shifted-placebo fires.
- Raw average HR exists for 110 recent sessions but correlates 0.83 with the
  measured-time zone-intensity outcome. It is not added as another hypothesis:
  it would duplicate that outcome while losing the swim HR offset applied by
  zone classification. The high-zone fraction already supplies the distinct
  “how often did I reach hard effort?” question. In an isolated three-candidate
  check, prior-day HRV versus high-zone fraction looked like a watch; across the
  full 15-test multiplicity pool its q-value is 0.416 and it correctly returns
  to no clear signal.
- Two sessions with fewer than five classified HR minutes in the current
  workout era now contribute valid duration outcomes but remain ineligible for
  HR-derived outcomes. They also remain in event history: this corrects two
  later recovery intervals; the largest changed from 22.2 hours to 19 minutes,
  and the short session's 5.15
  TRIMP contributes to the later session's same-day prior load.
- With the measurement-time and coverage corrections, previous-day HRV has 103
  sessions on 72 dates for duration and 93 on 67 for intensity; neither shows
  a clear relationship. The former same-day HRV-to-intensity raw signal
  disappears; it was compatible with within-day aggregate revision rather than
  readiness.
- Decoupling exists for only 14 recent workouts and HRR60 for none, so neither
  is a promotable workout-context outcome yet.

These are eligibility facts, not tuned thresholds. The thresholds above stay
fixed as data accrues.
