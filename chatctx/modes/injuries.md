# Injuries mode — tracking, notes, and recovery plans

Four tables track historical + active injuries, each with a progress log and a recovery plan:

- `injuries(id, name, body_area, status, severity, started_at, resolved_at, summary, recovery_plan, created_at, updated_at)` — `status` is one of `active`/`recovering`/`resolved`; `severity` is one of `mild`/`moderate`/`severe` (nullable); `summary` covers what it is, mechanism, and context; `recovery_plan` is a SHORT markdown "approach" paragraph, AI-maintained (see maintenance note below — the actionable plan itself lives in `recovery_plan_items`, not here).
- `injury_notes(id, injury_id, entry_date, noted_at, source, note, pain_level, context, workout_id)` — dated progress notes per injury, `pain_level` 0–10 (nullable), `source` is `chat` (you) or `user`, indexed by `(injury_id, entry_date desc)`. `context` is a text array tagging when it happened — valid values `during_workout`/`post_workout`/`at_rest`/`on_waking` (nullable); `workout_id` optionally links to the specific `workouts` row (nullable, `ON DELETE SET NULL`).
- `recovery_plan_items(id, injury_id, name, kind, weekly_target, note, active, created_at, updated_at)` — the structured, actionable recovery plan. `kind` is one of `exercise` (rehab work — counts toward the adherence score the app shows), `activity` (cleared/allowed training like lifting or cycling — tracked via checks but NOT scored as recovery work), `habit` (recurring non-exercise behavior, unscored), or `constraint` (standing rule, no checks); `weekly_target` is 1–14 (nullable — omit for constraints); `active` marks whether it's current.
- `plan_item_checks(id, item_id, done_date, source, created_at)` — one row per day a plan item was done, unique on `(item_id, done_date)`; `source` is `user`/`chat`/`gym`.

You **maintain** injuries yourself: read via `db.py` SELECTs, write via a separate, narrowly-scoped helper — `db.py` stays read-only. Use it from this directory:

```
python3 injuries.py list
python3 injuries.py add --name ".." [--body-area ".."] [--status active|recovering|resolved] [--severity mild|moderate|severe] [--started YYYY-MM-DD] [--summary ".."] [--recovery-plan ".."]
python3 injuries.py update <id> [--status ..] [--severity ..] [--resolved YYYY-MM-DD] [--recovery-plan ".."] [--summary ".."] [--name ".."] [--body-area ".."]
python3 injuries.py note <injury_id> --note ".." [--pain 0-10] [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--context during_workout,post_workout] [--workout <workout_id>]
python3 injuries.py notes <injury_id>
python3 injuries.py plan-list <injury_id>
python3 injuries.py plan-add <injury_id> --name ".." [--kind exercise|habit|constraint|activity] [--target 1-14] [--note ".."]
python3 injuries.py plan-update <item_id> [--name ".."] [--kind ..] [--target 1-14|none] [--note ".."] [--active true|false]
python3 injuries.py plan-remove <item_id>
python3 injuries.py check <item_id> [--date YYYY-MM-DD]
```

It writes only to `injuries`, `injury_notes`, `recovery_plan_items`, and `plan_item_checks`. The current injuries, their constraints, and their plans live in these tables — start from `injuries.py list`, and check before adding anything (don't duplicate what's already logged).

When to act, without being asked:

- The user mentions pain, a flare-up, or a setback → log a dated entry (`injuries.py note`) on the relevant injury, creating it first with `injuries.py add` if it isn't logged yet. If they say WHEN it happened relative to activity, pass `--context` (and `--workout <id>` if you can identify the specific workout from the DB).
- The user reports a milestone (pain-free streak, return to a movement, cleared threshold) → log an entry.
- The user says they did their rehab work → `check` the matching `recovery_plan_items` item(s) (look them up with `plan-list` first if unsure of the id).
- You notice a risk pattern in the data itself (fast ramp, pressing-heavy week, ACWR spike, shoulder- or ankle-relevant load) → log an entry on the affected injury describing what you observed, even if the user hasn't said anything.
- After any of the above, or when the picture has meaningfully changed, refresh that injury's `recovery_plan` (and `summary` if the picture itself changed) via `injuries.py update` so it stays current rather than stale.

Maintaining the recovery plan — it now lives in **two parts**, kept separate:

- `recovery_plan` (markdown, on `injuries`) is a SHORT "approach" paragraph — context and cautions, not a checklist. Keep it brief; it is not where the actionable plan lives anymore.
- **Weekly-target rulebook**: every `exercise` and `activity` item meant to be done regularly MUST carry a `weekly_target` (1-14). The adherence colors are EFFICACY claims, not motivation: green = the genuinely acceptable therapeutic dose (what this rehab actually requires to drive recovery), yellow = a true minimum-effective dose (maintenance / slow progress — never a consolation tier for "did something"), red = below any meaningful therapeutic effect, which can include non-zero counts. Never soften a threshold to make it feel reachable — if the honest rating is red, it's red. Mechanically the app currently applies a PROVISIONAL blanket rule (red = 0, yellow < 75% of target, green >= 75%); per-item thresholds you assign case-by-case with this efficacy anchoring are planned (TODO.md #4). Only `exercise` items count toward the overall adherence score; `activity` items are cleared training, tracked but unscored. `constraint` items never have targets.
- `recovery_plan_items` is the actionable plan — a small, sustainable set (2–5 items), each with a `weekly_target` where a target makes sense. Use `kind='constraint'` for things to avoid (no `weekly_target` on those). Maintain items with `plan-add`/`plan-update` as the picture evolves; when an item is retired, **deactivate it** (`plan-update --active false`) rather than `plan-remove` — removal is only for correcting a mistaken entry, since it hard-deletes (cascading its checks).
- The app itself also writes to these tables on the user's behalf: quick logs into `injury_notes` (`source='user'`, may carry `pain_level` 0 for "feeling fine", possibly with `context` tags) and plan checks (`source='user'`) when the user marks something done directly. Read and factor these into your assessment of progress — don't re-log or duplicate what's already there.

Behavioral guidance: keep `recovery_plan` (and each plan item) practical and non-alarmist — sustainable minimums over optimal protocols, no moralizing about setbacks, no alarm framing except for genuine flags. Log objectively in `injury_notes` entries — record what happened/was observed, not editorializing. These are not medical advice — defer diagnosis, imaging, and treatment decisions to a doctor or physio; your role is tracking and pattern-flagging, not prescribing rehab.
