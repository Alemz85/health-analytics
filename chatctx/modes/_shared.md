## How to use the helper scripts

`db.py`, `gym.py`, `injuries.py`, `goals.py` and `agent_log.py` are **fast paths for common operations** — they exist so you can do the usual things in one command without re-deriving the schema every session. They are NOT a list of the only things you are allowed to do, and the verbs documented here are not the edge of your judgement.

Concretely, you may and should:

- **Read the helper's source and `--help`.** Both outrank this file: the docs go stale, the tool does not. If a documented invocation and the tool disagree, the tool is right — follow it and log the drift (`agent_log.py`, `--category instructions`).
- **Query `information_schema`** to check what a table actually has before trusting a column list written down here. The documented schema below has been wrong before.
- **Reason from the underlying tables** when no helper verb fits. Say plainly that the helper has no path for what's needed, then do the direct thing (a scoped PostgREST write, a targeted `PATCH`) rather than bending the user's request into a verb that happens to exist. Reshaping a request to fit an available command is worse than reaching past it — that is how a request for a template edit turns into an unasked-for recovery-plan write.
- **Tell the user when a capability is genuinely missing**, so it gets built. Log it (`agent_log.py --category tool`). Do not tell them a correction is impossible until you have checked the tool itself — twice now, the verb existed.

Two guardrails are deliberate and do not bend:

- **`db.py` is read-only.** Writes go through the scoped helpers or a deliberate, explained direct write — never by trying to smuggle a mutation through `db.py`.
- **Never fabricate what the user reported.** Pain levels, reps, weights, dates: log what they said, leave the rest null. A plausible number you invented is worse than a blank field.

## Metric definitions (as computed in this system)

- **TRIMP (Edwards)**: per workout, minutes in each heart-rate zone × the zone number (1–5), summed. Zones are Karvonen: fraction of heart-rate reserve above recent resting HR, with swim samples shifted +10 bpm before classification. It is the system's single training-load unit.
- **CTL / ATL / TSB**: exponentially weighted averages of daily TRIMP with 42-day and 7-day time constants; TSB = CTL − ATL. CTL ≈ fitness trend, ATL ≈ recent fatigue, negative TSB = carrying fatigue.
- **ACWR**: mean TRIMP of the last 7 days ÷ mean of the last 28. Values well above ~1.5 indicate a fast ramp; null with under 21 days of history.
- **EF (efficiency factor)**: swims only — (meters per minute) ÷ average HR, computed only when ≥70% of the session sat in Z1–Z2 and it lasted ≥20 min. Rising EF at constant effort = aerobic base improving.
- **Decoupling**: for EF-eligible swims, HR drift between first and second half of the session ((avgHR₂−avgHR₁)/avgHR₁ × 100). Under ~5% = aerobically steady.
- **HRR60**: heart-rate drop 60s after a workout ends; usually null (the export rarely includes post-workout samples).
- **SWOLF₍25₎**: per swim set, (seconds + 2×strokes) normalized per 25 m of that set. Stored strokes are Apple watch-arm counts (≈ one per stroke cycle); doubling converts to the textbook both-hands convention — exact for freestyle/backstroke, overcounts breast/fly (accepted: the user swims almost exclusively freestyle, and HAE never exports stroke style). Lower is better at equal effort; compare within similar set distances.
- **sleep_start / sleep_end**: the watch's detected sleep ONSET and final wake — not bedtime, and not time in bed. **Nothing in this database records when he got into bed**, so onset latency is invisible and `sleep_start` must never be compared against `user_config.bedtime_goal_min`: that comparison silently charges latency to bedtime discipline. It already has — "in bed between 00:17 and 01:39 every night this week against a midnight target" when he was in bed by 00:30 and the watch logged onset at 01:12, i.e. a 42-minute latency reported as a habit problem, understating adherence he actually had (agent_log #21). Bedtime is obtainable only by asking him, and it is worth asking: his bedtime plus the watch's onset yields a latency number neither source holds alone.
- **rhr_dev / hrv_dev**: 7-day median resting HR (or HRV) minus its 60-day baseline median.
- **weight_7d_slope**: body-weight trend in kg/week — the 7-day rolling mean of daily weight (forward-filled up to 3 days to bridge sparse weigh-ins) minus that same rolling mean 7 days earlier. Treated as a slow OUTCOME variable in the insights layer, not a daily driver — correlations test it against sleep, rhr_dev, hrv_dev, and prior training load, not the other way around.

## Schema summary

- `workouts(id, external_id, type, start_at, end_at, duration_s, distance_m, energy_kcal, avg_hr, max_hr, raw)` — types like `pool_swim`, `functional_strength_training`, `indoor_cycling`, `rowing`.
- `workout_hr_samples(workout_id, offset_s, bpm)` — per-second HR traces.
- `workout_swim_samples(workout_id, offset_s, distance_m, strokes)` — per-second swim series for pool swims (meters/strokes attributed to each second; seconds with no row = resting).
- `swim_sets(workout_id, set_index, start_offset_s, duration_s, distance_m, strokes, rest_after_s)` — ingest-detected swim sets (new set after a >10s sampling gap; `rest_after_s` null on the last set). Pace and SWOLF are derived, not stored: `pace_s_per_100m = 100*duration_s/distance_m`; `swolf25 = (duration_s + 2*strokes)/(distance_m/25)` (stored strokes are watch-arm cycles; ×2 converts to both-hands, freestyle assumption).
- `daily_metrics(date, resting_hr, hrv_sdnn_ms, respiratory_rate, sleep_start, sleep_end, sleep_duration_min, sleep_stages, vo2max, steps, active_energy_kcal, wrist_temp_deviation_c, weight_kg, body_fat_pct, walking_running_distance_m, flights_climbed)`. `body_fat_pct` is a percentage 0-100 (not a 0-1 fraction) and only starts on 2026-08-15 — it entered the Health Auto Export selection that day, so every earlier date is null and no backfill exists. Never read those nulls as "0% fat" or as a drop from a prior value. `walking_running_distance_m` and `flights_climbed` are the ambulatory-load pair — the only columns that see walking volume and descent, and load-bearing for anything involving knees, ankles, or a trip on foot (a 61-flights day against a ~5/day baseline explained an ITB flare that the training-load model showed nothing for).
- `computed_workout(workout_id, time_in_zones, trimp, ef, decoupling_pct, hrr60)`.
- `computed_daily(date, trimp_total, ctl, atl, tsb, acwr, rhr_baseline_60d, rhr_dev, hrv_baseline_60d, hrv_dev, flags)`.
- `insight_correlations(var_x, var_y, lag_days, r, spearman_r, rank_disagree, n, n_eff, p_value, q_value)` — exploratory sweep; prefer `q_value` (BH-corrected, autocorrelation-adjusted via `n_eff`); `rank_disagree` marks pairs whose Pearson r is outlier-driven or nonlinear (trust `spearman_r` there).
- `insight_models(name, spec, coefficients, diagnostics)` — confirmatory layer. For `daily_adjusted_finder`: `diagnostics.candidates[].status` is the surfaced verdict (multi-night persistence over the nightly `raw_status`, so a fresh finding sits at `watch` for a week first), and `diagnostics.placebo` reports shifted null drivers run through identical gates — a nonzero `signal_count` there means promoted insights deserve extra skepticism.
- `user_config(hr_max, swim_hr_offset, zone2_low_frac, zone2_high_frac, zone2_weekly_target_min, sleep_goal_min, bedtime_goal_min, weekly_min_sessions, timezone, about_me, sex, birthdate, height_cm, protein_target_g)` — single row. `about_me` is load-bearing free text for sporting history, current circumstances, and communication preferences; read it rather than inferring a generic athlete profile.
- `blood_panels(collected_on, lab, panel_name, source_file, notes)` / `blood_markers(panel_id, code, label_raw, category, value_num, value_text, unit, ref_low, ref_high, ref_text, flag, method, position)` — the owner's own lab reports, transcribed from PDFs that stay off the network. `code` is a canonical analyte key (`hemoglobin`, `ferritin`, `vitamin_d`) stable across labs and languages; `label_raw` is the Italian name as printed. `flag` is set only where a comparison was actually defined — a null flag means the range was prose, NOT that the value was normal. **Read the rule below before using any of this.**
- `injuries` / `injury_notes` / `recovery_plan_items` / `plan_item_checks` — see `modes/injuries.md`.
- `goals` / `goal_progress` — see `modes/goals.md`.
- `gym_sessions(workout_id, template_id, performed_at, title, notes, body_parts)` / `gym_sets(session_id, exercise_id, position, reps, weight_kg, rpe, is_warmup)` / `exercises(name, aliases, body_part, primary_muscles, secondary_muscles, equipment, mechanics, movement_pattern, source)` / `gym_templates` + `gym_template_exercises` — user-logged lifting content, attached to synced strength workouts via `workout_id`. Granularity ladder, all deliberate: full per-set logs → set-less quick log against a template → `body_parts` array only ("did legs + core"). Muscle/volume analytics: join `gym_sets` → `exercises` for `primary_muscles`/`movement_pattern` (curated catalog rows have `source='catalog'`; user-typed customs may carry only a name). The user normally logs in the app's Gym tab; you can log on request via `gym.py` (below).

## Logging gym sessions on request

When the user tells you what they lifted ("did legs today — 3×8×80 squats, some lunges"), log it with the scoped helper (`db.py` stays read-only):

```
python3 gym.py list [--days 30]
python3 gym.py log --json '{"date": "2026-07-12", "title": "Legs", "body_parts": ["legs"], "sets": [{"exercise": "back squat", "sets": 3, "reps": 8, "kg": 80}]}'
python3 gym.py delete <session_id>
```

Each set takes exactly one dose measure: `"reps"` or `"secs"` for a hold — `{"exercise": "wall sit", "sets": 3, "secs": 45}`. Never log a hold as `"reps": 1`; a 60-second wall sit and a 1-second twitch would store identically and both would be false.

**A blank weight is not bodyweight.** `gym_sets.weight_kg = null` means two incompatible things — the movement carries no external load (pelvic drop, prone T-raise), or nobody typed the number for a loaded one — and the row itself cannot tell you which. `gym.py list` now reads the exercise's catalog `equipment` and renders them apart: `15xbw` where the movement genuinely carries none, `15x?kg` where the weight is missing (a loaded movement, or one with no equipment recorded — enrich it with `exercise-update --equipment ..`). **Never read `?kg` as a load, and never compare it to a later weighted session as if it were one**: treating a blank Leg Extension as bodyweight invented a load increase and a rep drop that never happened, and a coaching observation got built on top of it (agent_log #17). When it matters, ask him for the weight rather than inferring one. `log` prints a warning naming any working set left without a weight on a loaded movement.

Rules: log only what the user actually states — never invent reps/weights; leave fields they didn't give as null (a `body_parts`-only log is valid and better than fabricated sets). Check `gym.py list` first so you don't double-log a session the user already entered in the app; if a synced strength workout exists for that day (`workouts`, type ~ strength/core), pass its id as `workout_id` so the log attaches to it. Exercise names resolve against the `exercises` catalog including aliases; on a no-match the command aborts with suggestions — only add `"create": true` when it's genuinely a new exercise, not a near-miss of an existing one. Sets of exercises linked to recovery-plan items auto-check the day's rehab item (`source='gym'`) — mention it when it happens. `delete` is for correcting your own mis-logs, not for removing the user's app-entered sessions.

## Maintaining the exercise catalog

The `exercises` catalog is yours to write, not only to read from:

```
python3 gym.py exercise-list [--query ".."] [--source user|catalog] [--incomplete]
python3 gym.py exercise-add --name ".." [--body-part ..] [--primary-muscles "quadriceps,glutes"] [--secondary-muscles ".."] [--equipment ..] [--mechanics compound|isolation] [--movement-pattern ..] [--aliases "a,b"]
python3 gym.py exercise-update <name|id> [--rename ".."] [same attribute flags]
```

`exercise-add` mints a complete row directly — you never need to route a catalog addition through a fabricated session or an unrelated recovery-plan item to get one created. `exercise-update` patches only the flags you pass, so it is the way to enrich a row that was created name-only.

**Always fill `primary_muscles`.** The muscle and volume analytics join `gym_sets → exercises` on it, so a row with an empty muscle array is silently dropped from them — nothing errors, the body part just under-reports. `exercise-list --incomplete` lists the rows in that state. The same attributes can be passed inline wherever `"create": true` appears (a `log` set, a template exercise), so a row minted mid-task is as complete as one added deliberately.

## Creating reusable Gym workout templates

When the user asks you to create, save, or add a workout plan/template, the deliverable is database-backed reusable Gym templates, not a prose routine and not logged sessions. Use the complete contract:

```
python3 gym.py template-list
node workout_template_contract.mjs template > /tmp/workout-templates.json
node workout_template_contract.mjs validate /tmp/workout-templates.json
python3 gym.py template-apply --file /tmp/workout-templates.json
```

Before authoring, read active goals, injuries/constraints, relevant training history, and the exercise catalog as needed. Every exercise needs a set count and exactly ONE dose measure: `"reps"` (1-500) or `"secs"` (1-3600) for a prescribed hold. A timed exercise is written as `{"exercise": "Wall Sit", "sets": 3, "secs": 45}` — never as `1 rep` with the duration explained in a note. Leave starting weight null unless the user supplied it or asked for a justified value. Put progression, rep-range context, RIR, rest, and session-duration guidance in template/exercise notes—the expanded card renders exercise notes below the name.

A template may also mint the catalog row it needs: add `"create": true` to that exercise, plus whatever catalog metadata you know (`body_part`, `primary_muscles`, `equipment`, `mechanics`, `movement_pattern`, `aliases`) — same shape and same vocabulary as `exercise-add`. A template write is never blocked because a physio-prescribed movement isn't catalogued yet, and it must not be routed through an unrelated recovery-plan item to get one created. Passing metadata without `"create": true` is rejected: editing an existing row is `exercise-update`'s job.

The Node `validate` step checks document shape only; `template-apply` resolves every catalog exercise before its first write and aborts without changes if any name fails. `template-apply` is idempotent by case-insensitive template name: it updates the named templates and their ordered exercise rows while leaving unrelated templates and every gym session untouched. A template can accumulate several versions (via `create-version`) that all share the same name — `template-apply` matches by name against each family's CURRENT version only, so it edits that version IN PLACE (its own version history is never a "duplicate name" conflict); it still aborts if two different families' current versions genuinely collide on a name. Validate before applying, then run `template-list` to verify the saved result.

To remove a template rather than update it:

```
python3 gym.py template-archive <template_id>
python3 gym.py template-delete <template_id>
```

`template-archive` sets `archived=true` on that one version only — other versions in the family and any runs are untouched. `template-delete` hard-deletes that version and its exercise rows, and refuses (pointing you at `template-archive` instead) if any logged `gym_sessions` or `gym_template_runs` history still references it.

Data quirks: watch data starts July 2025; resting HR / HRV / sleep exist on ~half of days (watch not always worn); `distance_m` exists only for swims and walks.

**The load model is blind to unlogged walking.** TRIMP comes from a workout's heart-rate zones, so a day with no logged workout scores `trimp_total = 0` no matter how much walking it contained — 24,346 steps / 18.8 km / 61 flights on 2026-07-30 scored zero. Everything derived from TRIMP inherits that blindness: CTL, ATL, TSB and ACWR all read "rested and fresh" across what may be the highest mechanical-load week in the record. Before reporting freshness or a light week, check `steps` / `walking_running_distance_m` / `flights_climbed` for the same days, and say which kind of load you mean. (The Zone-2 index is the exception — `metrics/models.py` feeds unlogged ambulatory activity into it via daily active energy, so the Z2 index and the CTL family can legitimately disagree about the same week.)

## Blood panels — context only, never interpretation

Lab results are in the database so you have context, not so you can practise
medicine. The line, and it is not a soft one:

- **You may** reference a value as background when it is genuinely relevant to
  something the user raised — e.g. that ferritin was mid-range at the last panel,
  when discussing fatigue in training.
- **You may not** interpret, diagnose, explain what an out-of-range value means,
  speculate about causes, suggest it explains a symptom, or recommend supplements,
  retesting, or any action based on one. That holds even when the user asks
  directly, and even when the answer seems obvious.
- **Anything flagged goes to a doctor.** Say so plainly, once, without hedging or
  lecturing, and move on to what you can help with.

Two things that make silent errors easy here, so check both before quoting a number:

1. **Check the date.** `collected_on` can be years old. A panel from a previous
   training era describes a body that has since changed — never present a stale
   value as current status. Say when it was taken, every time.
2. **A null `flag` does not mean normal.** It means no numeric comparison was
   possible (the report printed the range as prose). Quote `ref_text` as printed
   rather than forming your own verdict.

This matches the app's own framing (`README` "Purpose & scope": informational,
not medical) and the Profile tab, which shows the same values with the same
disclaimer.

## Agent issue log — self-report problems you hit

Observations about broken or misleading things die with the session unless you log them. The `agent_log` table is the bug tracker for that; write to it via the scoped helper (`db.py` stays read-only):

```
python3 agent_log.py log --category knowledge|schema|tool|data|instructions|other --subject ".." --detail ".." [--severity info|issue|blocker] [--session-hint ".."]
python3 agent_log.py list [--category ..] [--unresolved]
python3 agent_log.py counts
python3 agent_log.py resolve <id>
```

`--subject` is the join key for counting repeated flags — use one canonical string per thing: a file path for knowledge entries, the table/column name for schema issues, the tool/helper name for tool issues.

Log, without being asked, when:

- A query or tool invocation fails in a way that suggests a bug or wrong documentation (not a one-off typo you then fixed).
- A schema or metric assumption from your instruction files turns out wrong.
- A knowledge-library entry seems low-quality, inapplicable to this user, or contradicted by better evidence (`--category knowledge`, `--subject <file path>`).
- Data looks wrong in a way worth engineering attention (impossible values, gaps that don't match the known-quirks list above).
- Your instruction files steered you wrong — you missed load-bearing context, or mis-framed an answer, because no mode file told you to look (`--category instructions`, `--subject <mode file path>`). A resolution to "do better next time" dies with the session; the log entry is the only version that survives.

Keep entries objective and short: what was attempted, what happened, what was expected. No editorializing — this is a bug tracker, not a diary. Don't re-log a problem that already has an open entry for the same subject (check `list --unresolved` if unsure); `resolve` is for dev sessions to close entries whose cause is fixed, not for you.
